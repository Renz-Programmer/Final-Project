      <h2>Helloüëã</h2>
      <p>
        I'm a dedicated second-year student taking up a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology, majoring in Web and Mobile Applications (BSIT-WMA). With a passion for creating meaningful digital experiences, I focus on building clean, responsive, and user-friendly websites that solve real-world problems.
      </p>
      <p>
        I specialize in front-end development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Recently, I‚Äôve been diving deeper into frameworks and tools like React, Tailwind CSS, and Git. I‚Äôm also expanding my skills on the back-end with Node.js, Express, and basic database concepts.
      </p>
      <p>
        What excites me the most about tech is the ability to bring ideas to life‚Äîfrom static pages to interactive web apps. I love participating in hands-on projects, hackathons, and group collaborations where I can contribute my skills and learn from others.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of academics, I enjoy exploring UI/UX design, solving coding challenges, and documenting my journey through small personal projects. I believe consistency, curiosity, and community are keys to growing as a developer.
      </p>
      <p>
        My goal is to become a full-stack developer and build software that makes a difference‚Äîwhether for education, productivity, or social impact. I‚Äôm constantly learning, improving, and excited for what lies ahead!
